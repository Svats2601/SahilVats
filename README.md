# Hi, I’m Sahil 👋

I work as a Senior Data Analyst at **NielsenIQ**. I’ve been working with data for around four years now, mostly helping teams make sense of large, messy datasets and turning them into something actually useful.

I enjoy problem-solving, especially when it involves automating repetitive work so people can focus on better decisions instead of manual reports.
